# Notes
# Life & Death of Objects
- The STACK is where methods, invocations, and local variables live.
- the HEAP is where objects live.
- Instance variables like if ``` Class Duck ``` has ```int numberOfFeet``` that numberOfFeet ivar (instance variable) lives INSIDE THE OBJECT. Instance variables are declared inside a class NOT A METHOD!!!
- Local variables are variables that are created INSIDE A METHOD ```public void add (int x, int y)``` both x & y are LOCAL VARIABLES of the add method
